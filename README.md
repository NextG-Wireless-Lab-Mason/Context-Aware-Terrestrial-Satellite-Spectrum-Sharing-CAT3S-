# Context-Aware-Terrestrial-Satellite-Spectrum-Sharing-(CAT3S)- Case Study of 12 GHz Band



#How to Run the code:

1. Load all the data from the folder Codebook and also from the folder data or split_csv.py from "Context-aware-Spectrum-Coexistence-Analyzer" [1]. 
2. Run the rest_server.py which will send the necessary information to the simulator.py. Additionally to create the Environment of the DSA framework, access all the information from the DSA folder of the "Context-aware-Spectrum-Coexistence-Analyzer" [1].
4. Run the simulator.py which will analyze the I/N for all the MBSs and dynamically optimize the multi-antenna MBSsâ€™ parameters using a polynomial time complexity MBS control algorithm.
5. Run the app.py
