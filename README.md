# Context-Aware-Terrestrial-Satellite-Spectrum-Sharing-(CAT3S)- Case Study of 12 GHz Band



#How to Run the code:

1. Load all the data from the folder Codebook and also the folder data or split_csv.py from "Context-aware-Spectrum-Coexistence-Analyzer". URL: https://github.com/NextG-Wireless-Lab-Mason/Context-aware-Spectrum-Coexistence-Analyzer.
2. Run the rest_server.py from the DSA folder that will send the necessary information to the simulator.py
3. Run the simulator.py which will analyze the I/N for all the MBSs.
4. Run the app.py
